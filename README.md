# 🚀 Security Strategy for a Growing Tech Startup

## Scenario

You have just joined a fast-growing startup as the **first and only security hire**. The company has ~100 employees. Security has not been a major consideration, and decisions have historically been made based on immediate functionality.

### Current State
- Custom-built CRM solution hosted in AWS
- CI/CD tooling in use with multiple daily production changes
- Heavy reliance on SaaS for internal tools (email, office, etc.)
- BYOD (staff buy and expense their own laptops and accessories)

---

## 🧠 Initial Thoughts & Assumptions

- Immature security posture due to startup size and growth speed
- AWS architecture and CI/CD pipelines likely lack security best practices
- SaaS usage and third-party risk not tracked or governed
- Asset management is probably non-existent (no MDM, inventory, or patching)
- No phishing or security awareness training

---

## 🛠️ Initial Approach

Focus on **risk reduction**, not governance (yet). Start with identifying the highest risks using a lightweight, business-friendly approach.

### Scoping Areas:

1. **AWS Environment**
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**
3. **Third-party Tools and Company Assets**

---

## 🔍 Deep-Dive Scoping Questions

### 🔐 AWS Architecture
- Diagrams available? Endpoints exposed?
- Authentication and access methods?
- IAM roles and permissions
- MFA and SSO enforcement
- VPC structure and security groups
- Encryption (S3, RDS, etc.)
- Logging & monitoring (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, etc.)
- Availability and redundancy
- Secrets management

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
- Who can deploy to prod?
- Code review / approval process?
- Secrets scanning in repos?
- SAST/DAST in build pipelines?
- Environment separation (dev/test/prod)

### 💻 Company Assets & Third Parties
- Visibility into devices (inventory?)
- Device encryption, updates, and antivirus?
- MDM or DLP in place?
- JML process (Joiner-Mover-Leaver)?
- SaaS tools in use — what data is shared, and how?
- Vendor security assessments?

---

## 🧑‍💼 Stakeholder Engagement

Hold 1:1s with SMEs:
> "Can you walk me through how you do X?"  
> "How is Y managed today?"

Lean on any documentation that exists. If none, start creating it.

## 🔐 Security Control Prioritisation (Stage 1: Startup Phase)

### High Priority
- 🧠 Phishing training program
- 🔒 Encrypt PII in databases
- 🛡️ Deploy MDM (e.g., Intune), enforce AV/DLP
- 🔍 Scan public repos for secrets
- 🔐 Enforce MFA across assets

### Medium Priority
- 📈 Enable logging and alerts
- 💻 Transition to company-issued devices with secure baseline images
- 🔁 Introduce peer-reviewed change process
- 👥 IAM reviews (monthly/quarterly)
- 📋 Create and maintain asset inventory

### Low Priority
- 📄 Vendor risk assessments
- 🧾 Create policies/procedures (JML, Data Governance)
- 🗺️ AWS documentation/diagrams
- 📆 Medium-long term security roadmap
- 📜 High-level infosec policy
- 📏 Begin security standard alignment (e.g., ISO, CE)

---

## 🚀 Company Grows: 5000+ Employees, Global Expansion

- CRM and CI/CD scaled
- 100+ prod changes/day
- Subsidiaries acquired globally
- Client interest in security → SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance
- CTO wants a **tech-first** GRC strategy

---

## 🧭 Updated Security Approach (Stage 2: Mature Org)

Now shift from **firefighting to governance**:

### New Priorities

#### High
- ✅ Assume previous high-priority risks have been remediated

#### Medium-to-High
- 📄 Centralised, accessible policies/procedures/guidelines
- 📊 Build and operate formal risk register
- 🔄 Control effectiveness mapped to policies
- 🧩 Subsidiary integration into main GRC framework
- 🌍 Global regulatory compliance (GDPR, APRA, DORA, etc.)

---

## 🧩 Certification Challenges: ISO 27001 in a Fast-Growing Org

### 🚫 Common Challenges

#### 📑 Documentation
- Missing or siloed documentation
- Resistance to process/policy introduction

#### 🧪 Tech
- Diverse tech stacks, unstandardised processes
- Missing SDLC, patching, or backup controls

#### 👥 Resources
- Staff wearing multiple hats, no bandwidth for GRC tasks

#### ⚖️ Risk
- Reactive instead of proactive approach
- Lack of mature risk culture

#### 🧠 Culture
- Management buy-in required
- Need to **justify the "why"**
- Employee-level culture shift needed

---

## 🧠 Minimising Manual GRC with Automation

### Traditional vs. Engineering Approach

| Traditional GRC            | GRC Engineering                          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Manual evidence collection | API-driven evidence gathering             |
| Time-consuming follow-ups  | Continuous control monitoring             |
| Compliance-focused         | Security-first mindset                    |
| Siloed                     | Cross-functional automation               |

### Options for Implementation

#### ✅ Option 1: SaaS GRC Tool (Vanta, Drata)
- Use for parent org
- Migrate subsidiaries over time
- Single control set across the org

#### 🔧 Option 2: Flexible / Custom GRC Tooling
- JupiterOne, Backstage, Policy-as-Code, Open-source
- Map SOC 2 TSC to real-time data queries
- Continuous monitoring with minimal overhead

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Prioritise **risk-focused** security in early stages
- Transition to **governance-focused** security as you scale
- Invest in **GRC automation** early to enable scalability
- Get buy-in from both **management** and **staff**
- Tailor security approaches for **subsidiaries and regions**
