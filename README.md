# Octopus Energy Technical Task  
### Cieran Almond

*You have just joined a very fast growing startup as the only security person. The company has roughly 100 employees and the CTO has been making decisions about what is needed based on function. Security is not always considered.*

*You‚Äôve been hired by the CTO for your security knowledge and because you‚Äôll have a different perspective and priorities.*

*The company has built a custom CRM solution that it sells to clients. It is hosted in AWS and they use CI/CD tooling to make a handful of production changes per day. Any other services they need to run (email, office productivity, etc.) are bought as SaaS services. Staff are encouraged to buy their own IT (like laptops and accessories) and expense it.*


<h1 style="color:#9B26AF;">How would you identify and prioritise any potential security problems?</h1>
